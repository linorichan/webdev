        <p>Go to the <a href="#para1">last paragraph</a> </p>
        <p align="center"> <i>Biology is the study of living things.</i> A large variety of living things exist on the land, in the water and in the air.<br/>
            Living things include both plants and animals. Thus, biology deals with the study of all plants and animals that lived or
            have ever lived on the earth.
